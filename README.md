# Custom Magic Mirror Project
For more experience and the ability to fully customize my magic mirror, this project was created.

### Modules
- Skycons 
- Moment 

### To Do
- Add Calendar to magic mirror with Google Calendar API
- Reformat the next 12 hour weather forcast
- Add News to the magic mirror
- Add a To Do List to the magic mirror

### Dark Sky Api
The api key was ommited from the Weather.js file, and therefore, a valid dark sky api key must be 
included on line 110 of the Weather.js file.

### ToDo
- Implement a calendar module using the google calendar api
- Create the ToDo module using React Hooks
- Reorganize file structure
- Clean up the main.css
- Possibly add a news module to the magic mirror


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
