# Custom Magic Mirror Project
For more experience and the ability to fully customize my magic mirror, this project was created.

### Modules
- Skycons 
- Moment 
- Material-UI

### Dark Sky Api
The api key was ommited from the Weather.js file, and therefore, a valid dark sky api key must be 
included on line 110 of the Weather.js file.

### ToDo
- Implement a calendar module using the google calendar api
- Reorganize file structure
- Clean up the main.css
- Possibly add a news module to the magic mirror


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
